MIMOSA is a system for genomic surveillance and outbreak investigation of microbial pathogens, developed within [_Genomic Medicine Sweden_](https://genomicmedicine.se/en/). It supports the identification, monitoring, and visualisation of genetically related cases across regions by combining whole-genome sequencing data with epidemiological and geographic metadata.

MIMOSA is designed to integrate with [JASEN](https://github.com/genomic-medicine-sweden/jasen) and [Bonsai](https://github.com/SMD-Bioinformatics-Lund/bonsai).
